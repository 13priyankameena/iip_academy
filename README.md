# IIP Academy Website Clone (React Version)

This project is a React-based conversion of a static HTML + CSS website into a modern, component-based single-page application.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to replicate the structure, design, and layout of a training institute website (IIP Academy) using React and JavaScript, preserving the visual style while improving code modularity, maintainability, and reusability.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
